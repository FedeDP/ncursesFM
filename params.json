Their content is kept in sync. Jump between tabs with arrow keys (left/right).\r\n* image previewing support through w3mimgdisplay.\r\n* config support through libconfig.\r\n* Basic mouse support.\r\n* Simple sysinfo monitor that will refresh every 30s: clock, battery and some system info.\r\n* Fast browse mode: enable it with ','. It lets you jump between files by just typing their names.\r\n* 4 sorting modes.\r\n* Stats support (permissions and sizes).\r\n* Inotify monitor to check for fs events in current opened directories.\r\n* Bookmarks support.\r\n* Search support: it will search your string in current directory tree. It can search your string inside archives too.\r\n* Basic print support through libcups.\r\n* Extract/compress files/folders through libarchive.\r\n* Powermanagement inhibition while processing a job (eg: while pasting a file) to avoid data loss.\r\n* Internal udisks2 monitor, to poll for new devices. It can automount new connected devices too. Device monitor will list only mountable devices, eg: dvd reader will not be listed until a cd/dvd is inserted.\r\n* Drives/usb sticks/ISO files (un)mount through udisks2.\r\n\r\n*To clarify: to paste/move a file you'll have to select it with space, then move to another dir or change tab, and press v/x.*\r\n\r\nFor a full list of feature, have a look at the wiki page: https://github.com/FedeDP/ncursesFM/wiki/Getting-Started.  \r\nWiki has lots of information. You'll find info about how to build, deps, config file...have a look: https://github.com/FedeDP/ncursesFM/wiki.\r\n",
