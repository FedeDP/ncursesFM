<p>Ncurses File Manager for linux.</p>

<p>It aims to be as user friendly and lightweight as possible, while being good looking (my own tastes) and simple.<br>
Being simple doesn't imply being useless; indeed it is a full featured fm.<br>
It can be built with a very small set of dependencies, as i tried to make as many deps as possible optional (compile time or runtime).  </p>
