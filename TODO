/* TODO:
 * nano launched in its own WINDOW * (not stdscr!) -> forkpty... ?? -> very hard
 * add other supported compress extensions (search about libarchive supported ext) -> very easy
 * use libarchive directly... -> hard
 * add option to compress files /folders (nftw...) -> i already have a skeleton function
 * try to semplify paste_file, cpr, recursive_copy and check_pasted.
