 * let ncursesFM build on non-linux systems (?)
 * 
 * in device_mode:
 * Add available space for mounted fs?
 * Move available space (and other info, may be, such as mount opts) to show_stat?
 * 
 * 
 * add small window to display current file fullpath /full name?
 * 
 * info_win shown only when needed? It stays 2s (only for INFO and ERR msg obviously) -> timerfd!
