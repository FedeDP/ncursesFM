/* TODO:
 *
 * update doc
 * 
 * in device_mode:
 * Add available space for mounted fs?
 * Move available space (and other info, may be, such as mount opts) to show_stat?
 * 
 * proper unicode support...http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/unicode.html?
 * 
 * vi keybindings/beybinding profiles
 * 
 * rework helper screen -> active-tab-mode-based content?
 * 
 * preview_mode instead of previewing global var. THis way, i'll be easily able to change preview tab (eg: pressing "j" while on second tab, will start preview on first tab)
