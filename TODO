/* TODO:
 * update DOC
 * install_packages segfaults on my netbook... can't understand why, really.
 * linux > 4.3 -> strscpy? -> http://linux.die.net/man/2/uname -> kernel version.
 * strscpy: http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=30c44659f4a3e7e1f9f47e895591b4b40bf62671
 * check_arch() will work on archlinux (in which package name has x86_64 or i686 inside. But it won't work on ubuntu for example, because it uses "amd64"...
 * -> next packagekit version should not crash: https://github.com/hughsie/PackageKit/commit/09ebef1ec578c886098cdbf839effc461d864817
 * -> and i'll remove chech_arch function if it won't be needed anymore
