/* TODO:
 * install_packages segfaults on my netbook... can't understand why, really.
 * 
 * check_arch() will work on archlinux (in which package name has x86_64 or i686 inside) But it won't work on ubuntu for example, because it uses "amd64"...
 * -> next packagekit version should not crash: https://github.com/hughsie/PackageKit/commit/09ebef1ec578c886098cdbf839effc461d864817
 * -> and i'll remove chech_arch function if it won't be needed anymore
