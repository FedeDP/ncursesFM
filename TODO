/* TODO:
 * 
 * install_packages segfaults on my netbook... can't understand why, really.
 * 
 * check_arch() will work on archlinux (in which package name has x86_64 or i686 inside) But it won't work on ubuntu for example, because it uses "amd64"...
 * -> next packagekit version should not crash: https://github.com/hughsie/PackageKit/commit/09ebef1ec578c886098cdbf839effc461d864817
 * -> and i'll remove chech_arch function if it won't be needed anymore
 * 
 * add support for password protected archives (libarchive does not support this feature...or it does but i couldn't find any doc about it...)
 * 
 * debug support: -DENABLE_DEBUG -> somewhere like /tmp/ncursesfm.log that will not survive a reboot.
 *
 * UPDATE README and PKGBUILD with new optdep/function (openssl/shasum support)
 * 
 * bug: print question and answer after resize.
 * bug: wgetnstr is a blocking call: resize is not performed until we leave that call...
 * FIXED BUG: if main thread is in ask_user and second thread print_info, print_info will move cursor away. 
 * 
 * FEATURE: add a "*" before selected files in list_everything
