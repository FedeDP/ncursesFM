* removed info_message global var
* splitted th in paste_th and archiver_th
* reverted strncpy use (no null-terminated strings...); back to strcpy.
* ask_user is back to "void"
* added default action (if enter is pressed) in ask_user. So user can just press enter when asked for y/n, and default action will be done.
* defaults to first entry name in create_archive function, if no name is entered.
* fixed a bug in scroll_down func
* fixed bug in is_extension; removed strrstr function
* Now using libmagic and get_mimetype function to understand whether it is a plain/text file (to open it), or an iso image (to mount).
* added "u" to view current file mimetype

5 / 6 / 2015
* better is_archive function. It is now faster than before, and search through archives use less memory and time.

5 / 7 / 2015
* Better integration between shasum_func and md5_func
* Added a warn message about md5sum being very slow if file size is larger than 100MB.
* added "is_thread_running" function.
* Better checks in manage_file, and in create_archive/try_extractor/paste_file.
* libarchive is not an optdep...

5 / 8 / 2015
* get rid of memmove; now copying with 'strcpy(dest, src + 1)' to remove starting "/"
* fixed little memleak
* moved every "access" check to first lines of functions

5 / 9 / 2015
* fixed new_file / create_dir bugs: if cwd is being pasted/archived, i can't create a file/dir there. Now gracefully managing this possibility.

5 / 10 / 2015
* check fopen/open errors
* fixed a bug in open_file
* fixed a bug in print_info/extractor_thread: i still need extracting glob var

5 / 11 / 2015
* added support for xdg_open while in X environment, otherwise old config.editor variable will be used to open (only, obviously) text files. With xdg_open user can virtually open every type of file
* better makefile
* updated readme and pkgbuild with new deps

5 / 12 / 2015
* huge rework: now you can queue as many copy/archive as you want, they'll be taken into care one after the other.
* switched to full path for namelist; solved some problems and finally removed "chdir" workardounds in list_everything
* get rid of sv.search_active_win -> now sv.searching will be equal to "3 + its win" : 3 for first tab, 4 for second tab.
* redirect vforked stdout and stderr to /dev/null

5 / 13 / 2015
* using safe_malloc in add_thread function

5 / 17 / 2015
* file_isCopied() will now check only the right depth level (ie: only head of thread_l, or everything).
* file_isCopied() and change_thread_list_head() will now lock a mutex before checking head, to avoid possible crash: if file_isCopied() was checkin head, and in the meantime change_thread_list_head() would change my head, the program would crash. It should be now avoided.
* fixed a small bug in print_info().
* fixed a small bug in create_dir().

5 / 25 / 2015
* fixed a bug while switching tab: now properly chdir inside new active tab path
* fixed a bug on 'c' press: ".." is no more selectable for copy/archiving
* changed internal thread list implementation; now it is more robust
* some changes in makefile: now libx11, libcrypto and libcups are optional build dep.
* probably some other bugfixing i now forgot about
* code cleanup
