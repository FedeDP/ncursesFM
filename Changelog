* added basic mouse support: left click to open files/move between folders, right click to select files, and mouse wheel to scroll up/down.
* when selecting a file in search mode, you'll be now moved to its folder, and the cursor will automatically highlight the chosen file.
* fixed an ui bug: after resize i called print_info("", INFO_LINE), thus rewriting INFO_LINE's only sticky mesg.
* removed fixed len wprintw in info_print as it is useless: const char *str will always be at most (COLS - len) long as it is mallc'd in print_info.

02 / 05 / 2016
* fixed iso files mounting. Now works fine and reliably.
* removed is_mounted and relying on mntent function (get_mount_points)
* fixed check_cwd function and moved those checks to mount_fs (only when unmounting), to make them useful even when unmounting an iso.
* fixed is_iso_mounted check: it will now perform check to see if a loop device with the same backingfile is unmounted (but already present...created by user or another program), and mount the iso on this loop dev, instead of creating another loop dev.
* moved SetAutoclear on loopdevices to its own function: it has to be called after add_device mounts the loop_dev.
* fixed a bug if compiled with clang ( uint8_t bytes = '\0' was const, with gcc worked fine, but not with clang)
* fixed add_device: relying on some udev dev property values instead of is_mounted function.
* fixed print_info: if info_win is not present, it won't do anything.
* helper_string (helper_win) content will now change together with compile time options, hiding the useless ones.
* libudev is now mandatory
* fixes in add_device: checking if a "size" property is really available for current dev.

02 / 02 / 2016
* using basename() and dirname() functions instead of manually strrchr path strings. Way cleaner and probably more reliable.
* using change_dir when creating new_tab to check for chdir errors and reuse more code.
* some more cleanup and internal changes. Most noticeably: do not ask user to kill worker th: instead ending screen and signaling user with a printf that a thread is still running
* fixed some small memleaks.
* fixed compilation with clang.
* now using "cc" to compile (ie: not forcing gcc anymore)
* fixed bug with isomount present since there's no monitor thread.

01 / 27 / 2016
* removed eventfd and using a pipe with O_DIRECT to divide main thread read from other threads write on info_fd.
* print_info will malloc a struct {mesg,line} on heap and will write its address to the fd. This way i haven't got to write/read all the struct.
* lots of bugfixes, see every commit
* some small improvements
* lots of doc added

01 / 23 / 2016
* using inotify and removed my own code to check for changes inside tab's cwd. Really better, lighter. It can now catch changes made from other fm/command line.
* fixed some bugs
* removed eventfd in worker_th (obviously it is useless now)
* added an eventfd for info print: now every print is done within main thread.

01 / 19 / 2016
* main ppoll will catch events from a timerfd (time + battery monitor's events) and sd_bus_get_fd (device monitor's events). 
Reduced number of static thread from 3 to only 1 (main thread).
Now it is slightly lighter on resources. There are less mutexes...overall code is way better than before.
* switch to libudev to poll for batteries. Way simplier and reliable than looking /sys/class/power_supply/.
* added some useful system informations print (uptime, ram usage...)
* fixed some bugs: new win_getch() implementation couldn't get resize event. When connecting new device, no info was printed.
* dropped term_size_check(), it was useless and too complicated (win_getch caused a deadlock with info_lock inside there. And there were other problems too.)
I hope nobody resizes the win so small it causes drawing issues. In that case, enlarge it.
* now using a eventfd in worker_th to signal main_poll that a refresh is needed for some tab.

01 / 16 / 2016
* added a clock + battery level line (useful as ncursesfm mainly targets non-X users, or users with a small X environment).
* added configuration entry to set low_level battery threshold. After this level, battery level will be printed in red.
* better bookmarks: you can now save new bookmarks from within ncursesFM.
* you can add whatever type of file you wish to bookmarks.
* better mutexes (info_lock and fm_lock); main_loop will now lock fm_mutex, worker thread (before calling tab_refresh) and mounter thread (in update_devices) too.
Way simplier than before. Every other draw is made within the main thread so no problem.
* fixed a small bug: info_lock must be locked before calling term_size_check() in resize_win().
* finalized bookmarks support. You can now add/delete bookmarks.
* fixed other bugs.
* added travis build.
* Using upower to get battery/ac status changes (connected/disconnected only)
* cleaned up some code

01 / 13 / 2016
* fixes for udisks2 monitor.
* added a "PropertiesChanged" signal match too, this way i can notify user if external tool has mounted some device
* added a new way of interacting with devices: 'm' to mount/unmount them, enter to move to current device mount point (after mounting it, if unmounted)
* now if unmounting a device, and 1 or both tab is inside it, move them in the folder that contains device's mountpoint before unmounting.
* added "unmount" with enter for iso files.
* initial implementation of bookmarks...it will just load bookmarks from $HOME/.config/user-dirs.dirs for now.
* added a "lazy" search mode: it will just check if searched string is contained inside inspected string (and it is case-insensitive too)
* using blocking ppoll instead of sd_bus_wait to make wait on bus signal-aware (i can interrupt it with a signal, and gracefully leave monitor thread/program)
* using blocking ppoll in conjunction with nodelayed getch in main thread and whenever a getch is performed; this way program can be externally interrupted by SIGINT or SIGTERM,
and everything is managed correctly (signal will only switch quit to 1)
* fixed a small bug in screen_init() related to term_size_check()
* switch to win_getch (ppoll + wgetch) in term_size_check() too.
* now you can select files even in fast_browse_mode
* now fast_browse_mode is a per-tab property
* highlighting active tab with green arrow.
* highlighting fast_browse_mode AND active tab with red arrow.
* some internal changes (improvements in readability)
* cleaned up some code

01 / 08 / 2016
* using an udisks2 monitor instead of libudev monitor to monitor new devices. It is simplier and far more reliable.
* device monitor will now show only mountable devices.
* removed config.monitor. Now monitor is always active unless no udisks2 is present or ncursesfm is built without libudev or sd-bus support.
* using strerror instead of provide strings whenever possible.
* added options to disable libs support in makefile -> something like "make DISABLE_LIBUDEV=1"
* probable some other fixes/improvements i forgot

01 / 02 / 2016
* Fixed a bug in add_device() call by device_monitor(): print_info() and automount were called even for wrong (discarded) devices...
* removed an useless check in device_monitor()

12 / 29 / 2015
* small fixes related to UI
* using warn log level instead of error when error is not critical
* added a log_persistency options (libconfig and cmdline) off by default, to save logs across program restarts.
* added a typesort function that sorts files by type.

12 / 20 / 2015
* fixed a bug in extracting/archiving when there already was a file with same name in current path (do not overwrite!)
* safer: using a safer version of realloc.
* safer: using arrays of [PATH_MAX + 1] or [NAME_MAX + 1] now (always enough space for null terminator char)
* fixed a small issue in search when MAX_NUMBER_OF_FOUND was hit inside search_inside_archive() function
* fixed a small memleak when leaving ncursesfm while a search was active
* some print_info() related fixes
* fixed a bug in shasum call from within main()
* fixed another long standing bug in extractor. It now works perfectly fine

12 / 18 / 2015
* fixed a small bug in ask_user
* added a (beautiful :D) logger
* added shell autocompletion script

12 / 16 / 2015
* fixed some issues
* leaving device_monitor loop now handled way better using pselect instead of select.
* better UI, with some improvements
* added a check_term_size() function to check whether terminal window size is large enough.
* inhibition will now be active during package installation too.
* fixed inhibition through sd-bus (it worked before, but it was implemented in the wrong way)

12 / 13 / 2015
* small fixes
* fixed mutexes (it should finally be definitively safe)
* fixed windows titles
* removed check_arch() before installing packages. Now just saying user to check arch because wrong one will crash program and packagekit.
* New FEATURE: libudev devices monitor(enabled by default), plus automounting support (disabled by default). It will poll udev for devices in background.
* performance improvement
* code readability improvement

11 / 25 / 2015
* lots of small bugs fixed
* finally safe behaviour: every print to any fm win, will lock a mutex.
* fully fixed resizing (now being-asked question and anwer won't disappear after resize)
* added back shasum support function: you can print a file sha{1, 224, 256, 384, 512}sum, or check if your file is not corrupted.
* added new feature: starting with helper_win shown by default. It can be disabled through config file or cmdline switch.
* fixed compilation without each optdep.

11 / 9 / 2015
* better and safer print_info, now with 3 lines: first for questions, second for info, third for errors. It has its own info_mutex now to avoid race conditions with worker thread.
* Better and safer resize_win: 1) locks UI mutexes (ui_mutex and info_mutex) 2) doesn't destroy every win but it only resizes and moves existent windows.
* safer show_stat: it locks ui_mutex too
* Lots of bugfixing related to resize and show_stat

11 / 4 / 2015
* splitted long job (that need a worker thread), from fast job, that can be executed in main thread.
* added support for changing file sorting (by size and by last mod)
* added support for accented chars (setlocale)
* getch is now a blocking call, so it uses far less cpu cycles
* bugfixing and internal rework (huge reordering of source and header files) + fixed lots of readability issues
* performance improvement, smaller mem usage
* removed signal to main thread; now using a mutex (safer and better)
* dropped libmagic
* simplified README
* probably something more i now forgot

9 / 30 / 2015
* finally support terminal resize :)

9 / 29 / 2015
* some work on makefile. Now using pkg-config to be as distro agnostic as possible when building.
* libudev support in makefile is now checked only if libsystemd support is enabled.
* removed fuseiso optdep. Using udisks2 and sd-bus for mounting iso too.

9/ 27 / 2015
* added fast browse mode: when enabled (with ','), pressing a letter will move the cursor to the first elem that begins with that letter, and so on (second letter, etc etc)
if letters are pressed fast enough

9 / 26 / 2015
* added ability to install packages by pressing enter on them, through packagekit; so it should be distro independent.
* The installation process is done in another thread. Before exiting, main thread will wait for the installation thread to finish its job, to avoid damages.
* fixed a bug: i forgot to change_dir() in current dir when ncursesfm starts.
* fixed a bug: when a call to generate_list is done during device_mode, update only the win in normal mode (before i did not update anything)
* fixed some valgrind issues/errors
* string_constants now only declared if correspondent LIB symbols are defined

9 / 24 / 2015
* added ability to mount external usb drives through udisks2 and sd-bus.
* fixed some bugs
* now any message printed inside info_win will last until a new message is sent.
* better README, update pkgbuild.
* better makefile checks.
* better sd-bus api checks
* probably other improvements i now forgot

9 / 18 / 2015
* fixed some bugs
* lots, lots, lots of internal changes.
* list of files is now a pointer to char[PATH_MAX].
* list of found files while searching is now capped to [MAX_NUMBER_OF_FOUND(100)][PATH_MAX], ie: it's a 2 dim array.
* it should now be more memory friendly.
* more accurate refresh of tabs.
* fixed a memleak.
* probably some little performance improvement.
* do not enter switch case in main_loop if user doesn't press any key.
* fixed (i hope) every valgrind error.

9 / 15 / 2015
* new option to lock powermanagement actions (eg: autosuspend after N minutes) while a job is being performed (eg: while pasting a large file) to avoid data loss.
This uses sd-bus api, so it is meant for systemd systems only.
* fixed a bug related to helper win while in search mode.
* added ability to trigger helper win showing in search mode
* added ability to create new tab in search mode
* removed stand-alone search_loop and using only main_loop.
* lots of internal changes, some fixes.

7 / 30 / 2015
* fixed some bugs
* every WIN* var is now static inside ui_functions.c
* removed flock() calls
* lots of other internal changes, have a look to commits since last changelog update

7 / 12 / 2015
* lots of internal changes
* got rid of mutex
* now every ps.fm WIN changes are performed inside main thread, way more reliable.
* small code cleanup and bugfixing
* something more i may have forgot about

7 / 7 / 2015
* fixed some bugs; now add_thread is always executed inside init_thread; this will fix some bugs in certain conditions
* only way for current running job, if a thread is running and user tries to leave; not for all the job's list.
* current_th now static inside helper_functions
* remove running_h

7 / 4 / 2015
* a few small changes
* libconfig is now compile time optional
* some more DOCS

7 / 2 / 2015
* better execute thread: now it is executed in another thread and calls running_h->f(); plus calls itself recursively. Way better now.

7 / 1 / 2015
* now using flock to lock files while a thread is using them.
* removed is_file_used function
* fixed a bug in main where file_stat was updated before a thread called generate_list. So file_stat had the wrong informations about current file.
* Using a mutex to avoid that while in main_loop there's the call to "stat", generate_list changed current_position (or something else).
* code cleanup
* fixed generic issues
* fixed a bug in extractor thread: it previously extracted the files in process cwd, and not in the dir the archive was.
* better thread safety

6 / 30 / 2015
* removed is_thread_running() func (using running_h ptr as reference now)
* fixed some small issues all around
* added a "[1/3]" style counter for jobs queue printing (eg: "[1/2] Pasting...")
* exec_thread() will now spawn a thread if it is not present. Every operation passed to init_thread() will be executed in a thread now.

6 / 29 / 2015
* fixed a little bug in init_thread()
* removed openssl support. This does not really belong to a fm function.

6 / 28 / 2015
* fixed some bugs
* semplified code, now way more readable and simple
* reworked thread_list; now every file operation (except for new_file and create_dir) will be linked in a thread_l struct
* print_info() is now way more readable and easy to understand
* added string_constants source file, with lots of const char used inside other source files, to improve readability

6 / 25 / 2015
* fixed a bug while switching tab: now properly chdir inside new active tab path
* fixed a bug on 'c' press: ".." is no more selectable for copy/archiving
* changed internal thread list implementation; now it is more robust
* some changes in makefile: now libx11, libcrypto and libcups are optional build dep.
* probably some other bugfixing i now forgot about
* code cleanup

6 / 17 / 2015
* file_isCopied() will now check only the right depth level (ie: only head of thread_l, or everything).
* file_isCopied() and change_thread_list_head() will now lock a mutex before checking head, to avoid possible crash: if file_isCopied() was checkin head, and in the meantime change_thread_list_head() would change my head, the program would crash. It should be now avoided.
* fixed a small bug in print_info().
* fixed a small bug in create_dir().

6 / 13 / 2015
* using safe_malloc in add_thread function

6 / 12 / 2015
* huge rework: now you can queue as many copy/archive as you want, they'll be taken into care one after the other.
* switched to full path for namelist; solved some problems and finally removed "chdir" workardounds in list_everything
* get rid of sv.search_active_win -> now sv.searching will be equal to "3 + its win" : 3 for first tab, 4 for second tab.
* redirect vforked stdout and stderr to /dev/null

6 / 11 / 2015
* added support for xdg_open while in X environment, otherwise old config.editor variable will be used to open (only, obviously) text files. With xdg_open user can virtually open every type of file
* better makefile
* updated readme and pkgbuild with new deps

6 / 10 / 2015
* check fopen/open errors
* fixed a bug in open_file
* fixed a bug in print_info/extractor_thread: i still need extracting glob var

6 / 9 / 2015
* fixed new_file / create_dir bugs: if cwd is being pasted/archived, i can't create a file/dir there. Now gracefully managing this possibility.

6 / 8 / 2015
* get rid of memmove; now copying with 'strcpy(dest, src + 1)' to remove starting "/"
* fixed little memleak
* moved every "access" check to first lines of functions

6 / 7 / 2015
* Better integration between shasum_func and md5_func
* Added a warn message about md5sum being very slow if file size is larger than 100MB.
* added "is_thread_running" function.
* Better checks in manage_file, and in create_archive/try_extractor/paste_file.
* libarchive is not an optdep...

6 / 6 / 2015
* better is_archive function. It is now faster than before, and search through archives use less memory and time.

6 / 5 / 2015
* removed info_message global var
* splitted th in paste_th and archiver_th
* reverted strncpy use (no null-terminated strings...); back to strcpy.
* ask_user is back to "void"
* added default action (if enter is pressed) in ask_user. So user can just press enter when asked for y/n, and default action will be done.
* defaults to first entry name in create_archive function, if no name is entered.
* fixed a bug in scroll_down func
* fixed bug in is_extension; removed strrstr function
* Now using libmagic and get_mimetype function to understand whether it is a plain/text file (to open it), or an iso image (to mount).
* added "u" to view current file mimetype
