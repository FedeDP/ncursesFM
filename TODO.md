## TODO

**GENERIC**:  

- [ ] symlink() support?
- [ ] use an hasmap to keep track of devices mountpoint? https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Hash-Tables.html
- [ ] improve interaction between ncursesFM and external mount tools -> if active tab is not inside mounted path, external tools can unmount that device. But if !active tab is inside that mount point, it won't be moved outside of it.
- [ ] update doc
