## TODO

**GENERIC**:  

- [ ] symlink() support?
- [x] fix bug in show_spcial_tab / leave_special_mode when no additional wins are present
- [ ] improve interaction between ncursesFM and external mounter tools -> if active tab is not inside mounted path, external tools can unmount that device. But if !active tab is inside that mount point, it won't be moved outside of it.
- [ ] vi keybindings/keybinding profiles (probably WON'T IMPLEMENT)
- [ ] update doc
