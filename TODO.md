## TODO

**GENERIC**:  

- [ ] symlink() support?
- [x] right click to go back to root folder, middle click to select files
- [x] FIXME in mount.c
- [ ] improve interaction between ncursesFM and external mounter tools -> if active tab is not inside mounted path, external tools can unmount that device. But if !active tab is inside that mount point, it won't be moved outside of it.
- [x] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character
- [x] mouse wheel to scroll, left click as enter, and right click as esc in ask user
- [ ] vi keybindings/keybinding profiles (probably WON'T IMPLEMENT)
- [ ] update doc
