## TODO

**GENERIC**:  

- [ ] symlink() support?
- [x] improve interaction between ncursesFM and external mount tools -> if active tab is not inside mounted path, external tools can unmount that device. But if !active tab is inside that mount point, it won't be moved outside of it.
- [ ] update doc
